Issues with converting 3x3 to 4x4 and what classes are too dependent on board's internal structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ComputerPlayer was testing on the board position in a way that was for a 3x3 board
Many places testing with a 3x3 board, in particular the board_spec. Is thorough testing of 4x4 necessary?
Display needed updating to select whether or not 3x3 or 4x4 board
Display print_board will need updating, we assumed 3x3
Many constructors instantiating board are having to be changed to explicityl state we want a 3x3 game. Default parameter perhaps the answer?
