Not happy with Game creation. Maybe more ruby idiomatic way of doing this
- change this such that input digits are within display class
Throw exception when non-square number given, or change size to be width_of_board


Issues with converting 3x3 to 4x4 and what classes are too dependent on board's internal structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ComputerPlayer was testing on the board position in a way that was for a 3x3 board
Many places testing with a 3x3 board, in particular the board_spec. Is thorough testing of 4x4 necessary?
Many constructors instantiating board are having to be changed to explicityl state we want a 3x3 game. Default parameter perhaps the answer?
