- messages actually need to be displayed
- board needs reprinting once move has been made


-game loop can be broken if next move is :awaiting_user_input
-human player now returns :awaiting_user_input, and it calls display.get_next_move which will set the game-state to playable(?), and allow for user to make a move
- game and GUI depend on each other and send messages to each other
- move is not valid if game already over
- throw exception if move is made when game is over


game state needs to be changed once display game over/draw has been displayed


Issues with converting 3x3 to 4x4 and what classes are too dependent on board's internal structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ComputerPlayer was testing on the board position in a way that was for a 3x3 board
Many places testing with a 3x3 board, in particular the board_spec. Is thorough testing of 4x4 necessary?
Display needed updating to select whether or not 3x3 or 4x4 board
Display print_board will need updating, we assumed 3x3
Many constructors instantiating board are having to be changed to explicityl state we want a 3x3 game. Default parameter perhaps the answer?
