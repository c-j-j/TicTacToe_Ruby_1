Issues with converting 3x3 to 4x4 and what classes are too dependent on board's internal structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ComputerPlayer was testing on the board position in a way that was for a 3x3 board
Many places testing with a 3x3 board, in particular the board_spec. Is thorough testing of 4x4 necessary?
Display needed updating to select whether or not 3x3 or 4x4 board
Display print_board will need updating, we assumed 3x3
Many constructors instantiating board are having to be changed to explicityl state we want a 3x3 game. Default parameter perhaps the answer?


Issues with GUI
------------------------------
Game loop needed modifiying to allow it to quit when waiting for user input
Game needed way to restart game loop later on
Needed to switch CLI and Game such that CLI creates Game, Game does not ask CLI to create itself
