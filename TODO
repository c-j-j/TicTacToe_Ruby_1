Tic Tac Toe : WEB

game probably wants to return a struct rather than a hash
styling
- css in own file
- just have fixed width cells etc, or use jquery to define text size
- better form styling/buttons

ResetController needs maybe renaming and TESTING
Refactor NewGame Controller to redirect to play_turn once it has created a game

CLI/GUI need to be refactored to use new play mechanism

Get EasyMotion working

Slow rails tests

Game should return struct rather than hash

game.play_turn to replace continue_game_with_move
game needs to be tidieed up

Desired tasks if time permitting
- better way to pass instance variables to erb in hash.
